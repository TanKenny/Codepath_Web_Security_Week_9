# Codepath_Web_Security_Week_9 Honeypot

-Summary:
A honeypot is a decoy used to setup cyberattackers and detect the attacks. 
In this week's assignment we had to setup a honeypot which meant we created a server and the honeypot. 
The server showed us the countries of attack and port in which was attacked.
We used nmap to see this in action.
